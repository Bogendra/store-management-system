# Installing notistack

To fix the remaining errors, you need to install the notistack package. Run the following command in your frontend project directory:

```bash
cd c:/Users/bbk04/Desktop/Bogendra/Projects/store-management-system/frontend-new
npm install notistack
```

Once installed, restart your frontend application:

```bash
npm start
```

This will resolve the "Cannot find module 'notistack'" errors in your inventory pages.
