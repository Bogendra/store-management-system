# Store Management System

This project is a modular, microservices-based platform for managing store operations such as inventory, orders, staff, suppliers, records, and analytics. It is designed for both standalone and SaaS deployments, using Spring Boot (Java) for backend services, PostgreSQL for the database, Docker for containerization, and React for the frontend.

## Features
- Microservices architecture (Spring Boot)
- PostgreSQL database
- Docker-based local development
- Modular: enable only the services you need
- Ready for SaaS or on-premise deployment
- Free and open source tech stack
