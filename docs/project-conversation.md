# Store Management System – Project Conversation Log

---

## Project Vision
You want to build a modular, microservices-based platform for store management (grocery/retail), supporting both SaaS and standalone deployments. The system should be scalable, secure, and easy to expand, with free/open source technologies for local development.

---

## Key Modules/Facets (Initial Scope)
- Inventory Management
- Order & Fulfillment Management
- Book of Records (Accounting/Finance)
- Staff Management
- Analytics & Reporting
- Supplier & Procurement Management

---

## Architecture & Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot (microservices)
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + MUI (SPA)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **API Gateway:** Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Auth:** Spring Security (JWT/OAuth2), RBAC
- **Config:** Spring Cloud Config
- **Service Discovery:** Eureka
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana
- **Logging:** ELK Stack
- **Docs:** Swagger/OpenAPI (backend), Storybook (frontend)
- **Build Tool:** Maven (chosen for stability and convention)

---

## System Design Decisions
- Each service is a Spring Boot app, with its own Maven module.
- Shared Auth service with a separate DB for user/role/privilege management.
- Row-level multi-tenancy using `tenant_id` in all business tables.
- Parent-child tenant model to support brands with multiple outlets.
- RBAC enforced via Spring Security annotations and JWT claims.
- File upload endpoints for Excel and similar files, with validation and security.

## Implementation Notes
- Maven chosen as the build tool for all Java services.
- Each service will have its own DB schema (PostgreSQL), with a separate DB for Auth.
- All code will be well-documented and follow industry best practices.
- Test cases will be included for all modules.
- Initial implementation will focus on the Auth service, then proceed to other modules.

---

## Outstanding Tasks
- Install and set up Maven on your system.
- Scaffold the Auth service and its dependencies.
- Implement Auth service (entities, repositories, security config, controllers, tests).
- Proceed to next business module (as per your choice).
